# Esh7enli Pro — Demo Static Site
This is a demo static website for **اشحنلي برو | Esh7enli Pro** intended for GitHub Pages.
Features (demo):
- Arabic + English UI with language toggle
- Order form for recharge / internet / game cards
- Admin page to confirm orders (stored in browser localStorage for demo)
- Manual payment flow (proof required)

How to use:
1. Create a GitHub repository named `esh7enli-pro` (you already did).
2. Upload the files in this ZIP to the repository root.
3. In repository Settings → Pages, set Source to `main` branch and `/ (root)`; save.
4. Wait a minute and open: `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/esh7enli-pro/`

Notes:
- This is a static demo. For production you will need a server/backend and database, and later integration with CCP or payment gateway.
- When ready, we will replace localStorage storage with a real database and secure admin login.
